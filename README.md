A fully featued Audio Player made for music enthusiast <3
NOTE: this project is still in development, we are open for any pr.

Current features:
- Audio Buffering (preload audio before playback)
- Buffer Queue (it is currently used pretty much the same as the normal audio queue you see in all modern music player, but allows for further extensibilty)
- Audio/Song Queue
- Managing Audio Buffers (Waiting, Ready, Playing etc.)
- Multiple song can play at the same time
- Getting song metadata

Planned features:
- Fading in/out, Lowpass in/out etc. Effects for transitions between audio
- GUI for buffer management (will be used for greater control over multiple playing audios)
- Audio Cutting (cut out unnecessary parts, when the file has an unwated intro/outro/pause)
- Automatic Audio Normalisation (fix some of your audio being too quiet and some too loud)
- (NOT SURE) Sharing files? custom network? embedded internet library?
- Ability to set custom transition for each file individually
